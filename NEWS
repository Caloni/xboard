** Announcing the release of XBoard and WinBoard, version 4.4.0 **

XBoard is a graphical chessboard for the X Window System that can
serve as a user interface for GNU Chess, Crafty, and other chess
engines, for the Internet Chess Servers, and for electronic mail
correspondence chess.  XBoard can also be used by itself.  It can read
and write game files in PGN (portable game notation).

WinBoard is a similar program for 32-bit Microsoft Windows.  It
includes all the major features of XBoard except email correspondence
chess.

A new release of both XBoard and WinBoard is now available.  Version
4.4.0 includes many changes. It is the first major release of
xboard/winboard after a fork of the project after version 4.2.7. It
includes small changes made in the main line and changes made by a
fork of Alessandro Scotti and lots of changes made afterwards by
H.G. Muller (released as versions 4.3.x). This release represents a
unified version of all changes made after the fork. It includes many
new features and bugfixes.

You can get both XBoard and WinBoard from the Savannah
project pages:
